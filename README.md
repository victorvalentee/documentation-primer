# A primer on documentation
_For all my future READMEs_

## So, what is good documentation all about?
> If more than two set of eyes should gaze at a piece of code, it has got to be well documented.

It serves the purpose of explaining your messy code to your future self, other developers and users.
Documentation should feel natural, but answering now what the reader will ask later.

> What might the reader have a hard time understanding?

Whatever it is, it must be in the docs.

## Let's talk about structure
You should structure your docs like this:

- Title
- Description
- Table of content (for big docs)
- Installation guide and dependencies, if any
- Usage examples (optional, but recommended)
- Code status (e.g. test status, optional)
- Contribution guide (optional)
- Known issues/bugs
- License (optional, but recommended)

## Github markdown things
- \*\*text\*\*    ->    **bold text**
- \_text\_        ->    _itelics text_
- \`code\`        ->    `inline code`
- \~\~text\~\~    ->    ~~strikethough text~~
- \[link\]\(url\) ->   [link](url)

You can also make lists (-/*), quotes (>) and task lists [x]/[ ]
